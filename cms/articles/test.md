# Physics Problem Solutions

## Problem 1: Rolling Object

**Problem:**
Starting from rest, an object rolls down along an incline that rises by 3 in every 5 (along it). The object gains a speed of 10 m/s as it travels a distance of 5?3 m along the incline. What can be the possible shape/s of the object?

[Ans: K R2/2 = 1. Thus, a ring or a hollow cylinder]

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we'll use principles of kinematics and geometry. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Incline**: The incline rises by 3 units vertically for every 5 units horizontally. This corresponds to a slope of \( \frac{3}{5} \).

2. **Speed Along the Incline**: The object starts from rest and attains a speed of 10 m/s after traveling 5?3 m along the incline.

3. **Calculate Acceleration**: We can use the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \), where \( v \) is the final velocity (10 m/s), \( u \) is the initial velocity (0 m/s), \( a \) is the acceleration, and \( s \) is the distance traveled.

   Solving for \( a \):
   \[ a = \frac{v^2 - u^2}{2s} = \frac{(10\, \text{m/s})^2 - (0\, \text{m/s})^2}{2 \times 5\sqrt{3}\, \text{m}} = \frac{100}{10\sqrt{3}} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 10\, \text{m/s}^2 \]

4. **Determine the Shape**: The acceleration of an object rolling without slipping down an incline is given by \( a = \frac{R}{2} \), where \( R \) is the radius of the rolling object. Since \( a = 10\, \text{m/s}^2 \) and \( a = \frac{R}{2} \), we can solve for \( R \):
   \[ R = 2a = 2 \times 10\, \text{m/s}^2 = 20\, \text{m} \]

   Now, \( R \) is the radius of the object. For a ring or a hollow cylinder, the radius would be the same across the entire shape. So, if the object were a ring or a hollow cylinder, its radius would be 20 m.

   This means the object must have a circular shape with a radius of 20 meters to achieve the given speed under the given conditions.

## Problem 2: Moment of Inertia

**Problem:**
A metallic ring of mass 1 kg has moment of inertia 1 kg m2 when rotating about one of its diameters. It is molten and remolded into a thin uniform disc of the same radius. How much will its moment of inertia be when rotated about its own axis?

[Ans: 1 kg m2]

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we'll use the principle of conservation of angular momentum.

1. **Initial Moment of Inertia**: The metallic ring has a moment of inertia of 1 kg m2 when rotating about one of its diameters.

2. **Final Moment of Inertia**: After melting and remolding into a thin uniform disc of the same radius, the moment of inertia will change.

3. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: When there is no external torque acting on a system, the total angular momentum remains constant. We can express this as:
   \[ I? ?? = I? ?? \]
   where:
   - \( I? \) and \( I? \) are the initial and final moments of inertia respectively,
   - \( ?? \) and \( ?? \) are the initial and final angular velocities respectively.

4. **Moment of Inertia of a Thin Uniform Disc**: The moment of inertia of a thin uniform disc rotating about its own axis is given by \( I = \frac{1}{2} m r2 \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( r \) is the radius. Given that the mass remains the same after remolding, the new moment of inertia \( I? \) will be \( \frac{1}{2} m r2 \).

   Now, substituting \( v = r ?? \) into the conservation equation:
   \[ I? \frac{v}{r} = \frac{1}{2} m r2 \frac{v}{r} \]
   \[ I? = \frac{1}{2} m r2 = I? \]

   So, the moment of inertia of the thin uniform disc when rotated about its own axis is the same as that of the metallic ring when rotated about one of its diameters. Hence, \( I? = 1 \) kg m2.
